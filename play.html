        <h6>THE TWELVE-POUND LOOK      _Sir James M. Barrie_</h6>
        <P>SIR HARRY. [_Complacently._] Did that seem all right, eh?

            <h4>LADY SIMS</h4><p>[_Much relieved._]</p> <p>I think perfect</p>
            
            <h4>SIR HARRY</h4> <p>But was it dignified?</p>
            
            <h4>LADY SIMS</h4> <p>Oh, very. And it will be still more so when you have the
            sword.</p>
            
            <h4>SIR HARRY</h4>.<p>The sword will lend it an air. There are really the five
            moments</p><p>[_suiting the action to the word_]</p><p>the glide--the dip--the
            kiss--the tap--and you back out a knight. It's short, but it's a very
            beautiful ceremony</p> <p>[_Kindly._]</p> <p>Anything you can suggest?</p>
            
            <h4>LADY SIMS</h4> <p>No--oh, no</p> <p>[_Nervously, seeing him pause to kiss the tassel
            of a cushion._]</p> <p>You don't think you have practised till you know what to
            do almost too well?</p>
            
                <p>[_He has been in a blissful temper, but such niggling criticism
                would try any man.</p>
            
            <h4>SIR HARRY</h4> <p>I do not. Don't talk nonsense. Wait till your opinion is
            asked for.</p>
            
            <h4>LADY SIMS</h4> <p>[_Abashed._]</p> <p>I'm sorry, Harry</p> <p>[_A perfect butler appears and
            presents a card._]</p> <p>"The Flora Typewriting Agency."</p>
