        <h6>THE TWELVE-POUND LOOK      _Sir James M. Barrie_</h6>
        <p>SIR HARRY. [_Complacently._] Did that seem all right, eh?</p>

            <p>LADY SIMS. [_Much relieved._] I think perfect.</p>
            
            <p>SIR HARRY. But was it dignified?</p>
            
            <p>LADY SIMS. Oh, very. And it will be still more so when you have the
            sword.</p>
            
            <p>SIR HARRY. The sword will lend it an air. There are really the five
            moments--[_suiting the action to the word_]--the glide--the dip--the
            kiss--the tap--and you back out a knight. It's short, but it's a very
            beautiful ceremony. [_Kindly._] Anything you can suggest?</p>
            
            <p>LADY SIMS. No--oh, no. [_Nervously, seeing him pause to kiss the tassel
            of a cushion._] You don't think you have practised till you know what to
            do almost too well?
            
                 [_He has been in a blissful temper, but such niggling criticism
                 would try any man._</p>
            
            <p>SIR HARRY. I do not. Don't talk nonsense. Wait till your opinion is
            asked for.</p>
            
            <p>LADY SIMS. [_Abashed._] I'm sorry, Harry. [_A perfect butler appears and
            presents a card._] "The Flora Typewriting Agency."</p>
